Welcome to the GitHub repository for my calculator app project! My name is festimreqi, and I'm excited to present to you a sleek and functional calculator application that I've designed and developed from the ground up.

üì± Project Overview:
This project showcases a user-friendly calculator app with a modern and intuitive user interface. The app is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience while performing various calculations. I've incorporated my skills in UI/UX design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to create an interactive and responsive application.

üé® UI/UX Design:
I've meticulously crafted the user interface (UI) of the calculator app to ensure both aesthetics and usability. The design follows a clean and modern aesthetic, with attention to detail in color selection, typography, and layout. The intuitive user experience (UX) is aimed at making calculations easy and efficient, whether on desktop or mobile devices.
